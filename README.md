**The SQL queries and dashboard are broken down into four key KPIs**
- Total Employee Growth
- Management Level Growth
- Average Salary Fluctuation Over Time
- Average Department Salary

**Employee Growth**
- Understanding the rate at which the organization is growing is critically important to determine department scalability and resource allocation.
- The massive growth observed in the stacked bar chart implies significant organizational health and a possible business expansion into new markets during this period.
- It also presents challenges to the organizaiton including resource management, additional training protocols, cultural changes, and strain on management teams.

**Management Growth**
  - As indicated previously, organizaitonal expansion includes the necessity to strengthen management teams.
  - The trend which can be observed within the area chart is that management followed a steady period of growth which coincides with overall employee growth, as expected.
  - However, the latter years observed within the data indicate that this trend has slowed and is beginning to regress.
  - This may signal a downturn in over business profitability, economic instability, or a possible area of over exertion in which resources and talent acquisition is required.
 
 **Average Salary**
- The salary growth line chart highlights a slight decrease overtime in salaries, with a significant increase in the year 2000, with an steady decrease following.
- This might indicate that the organization has prioritized bringing in new talent, rather than allocating additional resources to current employees.
- This coincides with a minor drop in new management positions, a correlation may possibly be derived from this. However, the constant increase of overall employee growth insinuates that this may not be the case and simply owes to an organizaitonal policy to increase the total workforce whilst slowing the intake of higher level management positions.

**Average Salary by Department**
- The final KPI, a side by side bar chart displaying the average salary segregated by departments, highlights where the organizaiton is focusing resource allocation and indicates as to which departments may be central to the organizational plan.
- Finance, marketing and sales all see the largest average salaries, whereas departments like human resources, production and research see the lowest.
- The organzation is currently focusing on spreading product awareness, improving overall adoption and usage rates, whilst also closely monitoring the financial risks and rewards of such a strategy.


# Summary
Overall it is clear that the organizaiton has seen a large increase in profitability and scalability over the last 12+ years. The key takeaways from this analysis include
-  Organizational strategy has shifted in recent years from prioritizing high level positions, to instead filling additional lower-tier roles across the company.
-  Whilst the organization grows, average salaries remain relatively stable and constant, and if we couple this with the decreased amount of new mangerial positions, we can observe that career progression within the organization may be limited. This could also point to a difficulty in retaining talent, whilst total employee number rise is the lacking salary rise due to a high level of employee turnover?
-  We can also observe what seems to be tactical financial restraint from the organizaiton, keeping wages at a relatively constant rate and allocating resources in a consrained manner point to the organizations key areas of profitability, interest and possibly their strategies for future growth.
